# Chrome Extension Idea: [Tab Aggregator]

## Authors

[Maya Chari, Shruti Agarwal]

## Problem Statement

Many times students have different tabs open for different classes or parts of an assignment. It can get time consuming and frustrating to search through all of your tabs, especially on different browser windows to find the one that you are looking for. 

## Target Audience

My target audience is students because students are generally juggling multiple classes at once and will often need browsers open for all of them. However, this extension can help anyone who finds themselves with many tabs open at once or many browser windows open at once.

## Description

The purpose is to aggregate tabs for a certain class or on a certain topic together. It will either autogenerate a name for this grouping of tabs based on their content or it will allow the user to name each group. When clicking on each group, it will allow you to easily scroll through the tabs. You will also be notified if you have tabs open that are "repeats" of each other so that you can close them.

## Selling Points

1. Groups tabs together based on common topic/class
2. Allows for descriptive names for each group.
3. Provides a UI that makes it much easier to read what each tab is (instead of having to read the top of each or hovering over each)
4. Provides suggestions on which tabs should be closed either due to inactivity or repetition
5. Improves the ease at with witch students can switch between tabs during an assignment

## User Stories

1. As a user, I want to have the tabs that I use most frequently next to each other so that I don't have to "go far" to complete my assignment
2. As a student, I want to have a condensed tab for each of my classes so that my desktop doesn't look messy even when I am doing work for all 5 of my classes
3. As a student, I want a reminder to close certain tabs that I stop using so that I don't have to manually check each tab in my browser and see if I want to close it
4. As a coder, I want a keyboard press to take me to my next most used tab so that I don't have to use my mouse.
5. As a user, I want the part of each tab I was last reading/on to be highlighted when I click to it so that I can efficiently pick up where I left off
6. As a user, I want to be able to customize a theme for each class (display mode, appearance, font) so that I can curate an personalized study environment for each class.
7. As a user, I want to receive a notification if I have a tab where my session has expired or is about to time out.
8. As someone who gets easily distracted by other tabs, I want the extension to offer a "focus mode" that temporarily hides all open tabs except the active one, allowing me to fully concentrate on the task at hand.
9. As a student, I want to set a 25-minute Pomodoro timer to focus on studying for an exam so that I can improve my concentration and information retention.
10. As a student, I want to easily see how much time I've spent working using the Pomodoro Timer to track my progress and ensure I stay on schedule.

## Notes

Potential features:

1. Puts tabs that you are most frequently on at the top or right next to each other
2. Potential feature: Either the use can manually input how much time qualifies as "inactivity" and then will get a notification to close that tab, or there will be a default setting.
3. When you click to a tab, the part that you were reading last is highlighted (whenever possible).

## References & Inspiration

I feel like I have heard about a tab chrome extension before but I've never used it and I think its more focused on memory.

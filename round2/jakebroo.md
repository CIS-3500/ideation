# Chrome Extension Idea: Style.it

## Authors

Jake Brooks, Akanksha Tripathy

## Problem Statement

I never know how to dress, and even when I get a sense of what a good outfit would be, I never know where to find clothes that would match my style

## Target Audience

Students who are looking to find new styles and show up to class in something other than a hoodie and sweatpants. 

## Description

The chrome extension would have a sidebar menu with popular outfits people have been making using different brands and brand mixes. It would also scrape popular brands for sales and for titles/items similar to the items that people are making their outfits with. (i.e. preppy men would likely recommend polo t's)

## Selling Points

1. It's hard to come up with outfits and this helps you generate outfit ideas
2. It's hard to find clothes you like and this takes the hassle out of searching for places to shop
3. Nobody wants to compare prices and open a trillion links so this could do that for you 
4. Checking inventory on items in your size would also be a key feature
5. Getting notifications for new styles you would be interested in would be sick (or go for a spotify daylist style "you are indie-mountain Wednesday morning style")

## Notes

It will be hard to scrape different websites since they all have custom inventory setups, so it'll be fun to play with that aspect. I'll probably use chromium and compile everything in a central server with a custom structure (if I'm allowed to run another server as a back-end to my project)

I really like the idea of coming up with labels and mixed styles so it's easy to express exactly what you want to wear and compare to what your friends wear

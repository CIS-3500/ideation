## Authors

Sampanna Bhatta

## Problem Statement

Penn students often struggle to find study partners within their courses, leading to isolated learning experiences and potentially lower academic performance. Our Chrome Extension aims to connect students with classmates who are seeking study partners, facilitating collaboration, knowledge exchange, and a more engaged learning community.

## Target Audience

The primary target audience is Penn students seeking to enhance their learning experiences through collaboration. This includes students across all faculties and levels who are looking for study buddies, project partners, or peer support in their academic endeavors.


## Description

The Penn Study Buddy Finder is a Chrome Extension that connects Penn students with peers in the same courses seeking to form study groups or find study partners. The extension integrates with the university's course systems, enabling users to sign up, specify their available times, and match with other students with similar schedules and study preferences.


## Selling Points

1. Facilitates finding study partners within the same course, enhancing the learning experience.
2. Offers a scheduling feature to easily find common free times for study sessions.
3. Integrates directly with Penn's course management systems for a seamless user experience.
4. Provides a chat and scheduling platform specifically designed for academic collaboration.
5. Encourages a community-centric learning environment, promoting higher academic achievement and satisfaction.

## User Stories

Round 1:

1. As a Penn student, I want to easily find study partners in my courses so that I can enhance my learning experience.
2. As a busy student, I want to find study times that fit my schedule so that I can efficiently manage my study sessions.
3. As an international student, I want to connect with peers in my courses so that I can improve my skills and understanding of the material.
4. As a project team member, I want to coordinate study sessions with my teammates so that we can work more effectively together.
5. As a first-year student, I want to join existing study groups so that I can make new friends and adjust to university life more easily.

   
## Notes

This Chrome Extension needs to comply with all university privacy and data security policies. A potential challenge is ensuring a user-friendly interface that seamlessly integrates with existing Penn systems. After we have this, it might be easier to popcorn and incorporate additional features such as peer tutoring or mentorship matching.


## References & Inspiration

Existing platforms like PennCourseReview and PennCoursePlan demonstrate the potential for university-specific academic tools.

Study group finder systems from other universities could provide additional insights and features that could be adapted for Penn students. Will look into this more.

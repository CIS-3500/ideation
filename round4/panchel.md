## Problem Statement

Managing cryptocurrency trades across multiple wallets, chains, and platforms can be a daunting task, especially for active traders and portfolio managers. Manually tracking buy and sell transactions, calculating profit and loss (PnL), and generating comprehensive reports can be time-consuming and error-prone. Additionally, setting up stop-losses and managing risk across various positions can be challenging, particularly when trading opportunities arise at any time of the day or night.

## Target Audience

The target audience for ProfitPeak includes active crypto traders and institutional portfolio managers. Active traders are individuals who frequently buy and sell tokens across various platforms and wallets, seeking tools for automatic trade detection to capitalize on market movements. On the other hand, portfolio managers manage diversified assets across multiple wallets and networks. They need features like aggregated performance reporting, multi-wallet and cross-chain support, and risk-management tools to optimize their strategies. These managers often must report performance to senior level executives and generating performance data visualizations are typically a hazard. 

## Description

The primary goal of the ProfitPeak Chrome extension is to provide a streamlined solution for cryptocurrency traders and portfolio managers to effortlessly monitor and manage their trades, positions, and portfolio performance across multiple wallets and blockchain networks. The extension aims to achieve the following objectives:Automatic Trade Detection, PnL Calculation and Reporting, Risk Management, Cross-Chain and Multi-Wallet Support, and a Customizable User Experience

## Selling Points

1. Time-Saving: By automating trade detection and PnL calculations, users can save significant time and effort that would otherwise be spent manually tracking and consolidating data from multiple sources.
2. Accuracy and Consistency: With automated trade recognition and calculations, the extension eliminates the risk of human error and ensures consistent and accurate reporting of portfolio performance.
3. Risk Mitigation: The ability to set custom stop-loss conditions and automate trade executions helps users effectively manage risk and protect their investments, even during periods of market volatility or when unable to actively monitor positions.
4. Centralized View: The extension provides a centralized view of the user's trading activities across multiple wallets and chains, enabling better decision-making and portfolio management.
5. Convenience and Accessibility: As a Chrome extension, ProfitPeak offers a convenient and easily accessible solution, eliminating the need for additional software installations or dedicated applications running in the background.

## Notes

Chelsea, Marc, and Rayyan don’t have much background knowledge with crypto, so they will need to do more research on the topic. However, they have a general understanding of most of the technical work.

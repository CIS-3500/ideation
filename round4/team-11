## Problem Statement

Online shoppers, travelers, and finance enthusiasts often encounter prices listed in foreign currencies when browsing the internet. This can make it challenging to quickly understand the true cost of products, services, or investments in their home currency. Currently, users must either manually convert these currencies using separate apps or websites, which interrupts their browsing experience, or rely on mental approximations, which can be inaccurate.

The target audience for Currency Converter includes:

- Online shoppers buying from international websites
- Travelers planning trips or purchases in different countries
- Financial analysts and investors monitoring international markets
- Students and professionals who engage with international documents and reports
- Users needing quick and accurate currency conversions while browsing

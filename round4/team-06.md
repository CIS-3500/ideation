## Notes

There is a lot of functionality that could be added on to this extension, depending on if we want to make a product that is extremely good at one thing, or a product that has many features all related to summarization and generative AI analysis of webpage content. 

We plan to use OpenAI’s API for summarization, given it’s reliability and extremely strong developer support.

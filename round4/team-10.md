## Problem Statement

Many individuals struggle with time management and productivity due to unintentional, excessive time spent on various websites. There is a need for an intuitive tool to help users analyze their browsing habits and increase the barrier to get distracted.

## Target Audience

- Students who need to manage their study time effectively.
- Professionals who want to minimize time-wasting websites during work hours.
- Anyone looking to improve their digital habits and productivity.

## Description

exTimesion is a Chrome extension that helps users track and analyze the time they spend on different websites. It provides detailed analytics on daily, weekly, and monthly browsing habits, identifying the most used websites, trends in usage, new and abandoned sites, and more. This information helps users understand their digital behavior and make informed decisions to improve their time management and productivity.

The extension further allows users to block websites that may be a detriment to browsing habits during work hours. 

## Selling Points

1. Easy time tracking: automated time logs for user activity. All operations run in the background with no disturbance or needed input from a user.
2. Detailed analytics: users can receive comprehensive reports on website usage across days, weeks, months, and years. Rigorous splits on usage cycles, common patterns, and various time-wasters enable easy understanding of trends and personal activity.
3. Customizable Alerts: Users can set time limits for specific websites and receive alerts when they exceed these limits.

## Notes

 - Consider implementing a feature for shared devices where each user can have their own profile.
 - Explore the possibility of integrating with other productivity tools or platforms for a more holistic view of the user's time management.
 - Regular updates and improvements based on user feedback can help the extension stay relevant and useful.

 This strategy may be very easy to circumvent if the block-list is easily modifiable. There may need to be protections against editing which sites are blocked.

## Technical Details

_[Describe the user interface of your Chrome Extension: What will users see when they interact with your extension? How will they interact with the extension? You can include rough sketches or wireframes to illustrate your design, but name your files `<project id>-ui-1.png`, `<project id>-ui-2.png`, etc.]_

TODO

_[Describe which Chrome UI/UX elements you will use in your extension, such as pop-ups, context menus, browser actions, omnibox, sidebar, etc.]_

We would use pop-ups to show specific page statistics/breakdown, and we would allow the user to open up a larger sidebar to show the entire dashboard of statistics, if they'd like to see a more detailed breakdown.

## Problem Statement

Many individuals struggle with time management and productivity due to unintentional, excessive time spent on various websites. There is a need for an intuitive tool to help users analyze their browsing habits and increase the barrier to get distracted.

## Target Audience

- Students who need to manage their study time effectively.
- Professionals who want to minimize time-wasting websites during work hours.
- Anyone looking to improve their digital habits and productivity.

## Description

exTimesion is a Chrome extension that helps users track and analyze the time they spend on different websites. It provides detailed analytics on daily, weekly, and monthly browsing habits, identifying the most used websites, trends in usage, new and abandoned sites, and more. This information helps users understand their digital behavior and make informed decisions to improve their time management and productivity.

The extension further allows users to block websites that may be a detriment to browsing habits during work hours. 

## Selling Points

1. Easy time tracking: automated time logs for user activity. All operations run in the background with no disturbance or needed input from a user.
2. Detailed analytics: users can receive comprehensive reports on website usage across days, weeks, months, and years. Rigorous splits on usage cycles, common patterns, and various time-wasters enable easy understanding of trends and personal activity.
3. Customizable Alerts: Users can set time limits for specific websites and receive alerts when they exceed these limits.

## User Stories

<!-- 1. As a person who works from home, I want to decrease the ease with which I can visit distracting sites to make myself more accountable -->
1. As a chronic doom-scroller, I would like auto-interrupt ads on a semi-random timer to break me out of habitual social media use

15. **As someone trying to improve sleep habits**, I want to track the time I spend on electronics before bedtime so that I can reduce my screen time and improve my sleep quality.

## Notes

 - Consider implementing a feature for shared devices where each user can have their own profile.
 - Explore the possibility of integrating with other productivity tools or platforms for a more holistic view of the user's time management.
 - Regular updates and improvements based on user feedback can help the extension stay relevant and useful.

 This strategy may be very easy to circumvent if the block-list is easily modifiable. There may need to be protections against editing which sites are blocked.

## Technical Details

### User Interface

_[Describe the user interface of your Chrome Extension: What will users see when they interact with your extension? How will they interact with the extension? You can include rough sketches or wireframes to illustrate your design, but name your files `<project id>-ui-1.png`, `<project id>-ui-2.png`, etc.]_

[View POC](https://github.com/rayan-yu/exTimesion/blob/main/IMG_D4ECF3952792-1.jpeg)

_[Describe which Chrome UI/UX elements you will use in your extension, such as pop-ups, context menus, browser actions, omnibox, sidebar, etc.]_

We would use pop-ups to show specific page statistics/breakdown, and we would allow the user to open up a larger sidebar to show the entire dashboard of statistics, if they'd like to see a more detailed breakdown.

### API, Libraries, and Frameworks

Tabs API (chrome.tabs): This is crucial for managing tabs within Chrome. We plan on using it to listen for tab activation, creation, update, and removal events. This way, we can start or stop the timer based on the user's activity in each tab.

Windows API (chrome.windows): Similar to the Tabs API, but for managing browser windows. It's important for understanding when a user switches windows, which can affect how we track time spent in tabs.

Storage API (chrome.storage): This API is essential for saving data locally on the user's machine for persistent storage. We would probably use this to store the amount of time spent on each tab, allowing the extension to maintain records between browsing sessions.

chrome.idle: Detects when the user is idle, which can help in pausing time tracking when the user is not actively browsing.
Content Scripts (chrome.contentScripts): While not directly involved in time tracking, content scripts can be used to interact with the content of a web page. For example, weâ€™re interested in showing an overlay on the tab that's currently being timed or inject specific elements to provide feedback to the user.

Chart.js: simple yet flexible JavaScript charting library that can be used to display analytics data through line charts, bar charts, etc.

D3.js: more complex and powerful library for data visualization that allows for highly customizable graphics. It's useful if you need more advanced visualizations.

Moment.js: now considered a legacy project in maintenance mode, it's still widely used for parsing, validating, manipulating, and displaying dates and times in JavaScript.

Node.js: running JavaScript code outside of a browser.

Npm: managing the project's dependencies.

Date-fns: modern alternative to Moment.js that offers a comprehensive, yet simple and consistent toolset for manipulating JavaScript dates in a browser & Node.js, to help in dealing with dates and times for analytics purposes.

Jest: Javascript unit testing.

Permissions: In the extension's manifest file, you'll need to declare permissions to use these APIs, including "tabs", "storage", "windows", and any other permissions necessary for your specific functionality.

Page Action / Browser Action: These APIs allow the extension to have an icon in the Chrome toolbar or next to the address bar, which users can interact with to view stats or change settings.


### Data Storage

Data to Store
Tab Information: This includes the tab ID, window ID (since a user can have multiple windows), and the URL of the tab. The URL helps identify the website, but for privacy and simplicity, you might choose to store only the domain name.

Time Spent: The amount of time spent on each tab. This could be in the form of a timestamp for when the tab became active and when it was closed or switched. Calculating the difference between these timestamps can give you the total active time spent on the tab.

Sessions: If you want to track browsing sessions, you might also store session identifiers along with start and end times for each browsing session.

Data Models
Tab Model
Tab ID: Unique identifier for each tab. (Primary Key)
Window ID: Identifier of the window the tab belongs to.
URL/Domain: The domain name of the website open in the tab.
Active Time: The total active time spent on the tab. This could be an accumulation of all active periods within a session.

Session Model
Session ID: Unique identifier for each browsing session. (Primary Key)
Start Time: Timestamp when the session started.
End Time: Timestamp when the session ended.
Tabs: A list or array of Tab IDs active in the session.

Time Entry Model
Entry ID: Unique identifier for each time entry. (Primary Key)
Tab ID: Linked to the Tab Model.
Start Time: Timestamp when the tab became active.
End Time: Timestamp when the tab was closed or switched.
Duration: Calculated duration based on Start Time and End Time.

### Risks and Mitigation

#### 1. Privacy Concerns
Risk: Users may be concerned about the tracking of their internet usage, leading to privacy issues and potential backlash.
Mitigation: Clearly communicate the data collection process, ensuring transparency. Implement strict privacy controls, such as anonymizing data and not storing sensitive information. Offer users control over their data, including options to delete it.
Contingency Plan: If privacy concerns still arise, be ready to adjust data collection practices based on user feedback and possibly consult with privacy experts to improve privacy measures.

#### 2. Performance Impact
Risk: The extension could slow down the userâ€™s browser by using too many resources, leading to a poor user experience.
Mitigation: Optimize code for efficiency, ensuring minimal impact on browser performance. Regularly test the extensionâ€™s performance across different devices and browser versions.
Contingency Plan: If users report performance issues, prioritize updates that optimize resource usage, even if it means rolling back some features temporarily to maintain a good user experience.

#### 3. Data Security
Risk: Collected data might be vulnerable to breaches or unauthorized access.
Mitigation: Implement robust security measures, including encryption for stored data and secure communication channels for data transmission. Regularly update security protocols in response to new vulnerabilities.
Contingency Plan: Develop a response plan for potential data breaches, including immediate security audits, notifying affected users, and working with cybersecurity experts to prevent future incidents.

#### 4. Browser API Changes
Risk: Updates to Chromeâ€™s APIs or policies could break the extensionâ€™s functionality or make it non-compliant.
Mitigation: Stay informed about upcoming changes to Chromeâ€™s extension development guidelines and APIs. Maintain a modular architecture so you can quickly adapt to API changes without a complete overhaul.
Contingency Plan: If an API update significantly impacts the extension, communicate transparently with users about potential delays in functionality updates and work diligently to adapt the extension to new requirements.

### Minimum Viable Product (MVP)
Collect "all-time" tab usage statistics: (1) how long a tab was "open" (in the foreground or background) and (2) how long a tab was "active" in the foreground. 

In the pop-up view of the extension, display these statistics for the currently open tabs in the window. The pop-up should be a list of tabs open, with each tab accompanied by two basic statistics: (1) time this tab was spent "opened" and (2) time this tab was spent "active" in the foreground. Each tab will also be accompanied by a bargraph, where the x axis spans the time the tab was open and peaks in the chart represent times the tab was in the foreground. 

The extension can be expanded into a dedicated page that shows the entire dashboard. The dashboard extends the functionality displayed in the popup by allowing the user to also filter by time ranges. This is done in the backend by simply filtering on the database by timestamp. 

### Stretch Goals
- Allow the user to close tabs in the pop-up window and dashboard
- Bucketing tabs by category

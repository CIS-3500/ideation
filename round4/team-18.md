## Problem Statement

Many people struggle to stay focused while working, especially because of the endless entertainment websites (Pinterest, YouTube, shopping, etc) that are easily accessible when browsing the web. In particular, it can be difficult for college students to block out large periods of time to study without getting distracted.

Our Chromagotchi extension provides motivation for users to spend less time on distracting websites and more time on school or work related websites. Spending time on self-identified “work” websites raises the Tamagotchi’s health, while spending time on distracting websites like Pinterest and YouTube lowers the Tamagotchi’s health! Through a cute and visually appealing interface, this would incentivize the user to spend less time on distracting websites and help improve productivity and focus. 

## Target Audience

Since this is intended as a time management and productivity tool, it will benefit people who struggle to stay on task and may get easily distracted by other tasks while working on one task. In particular, we envisioned that this tool would be useful for college students who need to set aside blocks of time to study or work. In addition, people who enjoy games and art could be incentivized by the visual Tamagotchi element to follow the schedule that they set for themselves. 

## Description

This chrome extension displays a miniature Tamagotchi, like a digital pet, at the top of your browser while you work. The tool mimics the original gameplay of a Tamagotchi: when you install the extension, your digital pet is "born" and you must take care of it, or else it’ll die! 

Upon installation, the user can choose their Tamagotchi's appearance, and specify a list of sites that are distracting. The pet starts off with a 100% health bar; for every 10 minutes spent on a distracting website, the Tamagotchi’s health drops! If your pet’s health starts to get close to 0, a pop-up will appear to remind the user to switch to a work or school related website. Spending time on these non-distracting websites will restore your Tamagotchi's health.

Opening a new tab will load a website that displays the tamagotchi and its health bar, the list of distracting/non distracting websites, plus information about the number of minutes spent on distracting vs. non-distracting websites in the current session. 

## Selling Points

1. Offers analytics on screen and web page usage, helping users refine their browsing habits for better time management.
2. Caring for the Tamagotchi encourages daily positive habits, such as taking breaks and focusing on tasks, enhancing productivity.
3. Encourages closing unused tabs and apps, leading to a more organized digital workspace and better device performance.
4. Allows users to specify which websites are distracting and which are work-related, allowing for customization to the user’s preferences.
5. Allows users to customize the appearance of their Tamagotchi, incentivizing a personal attachment to the digital pet, which makes the extension work better!

## Notes

## References & Inspiration 
One existing product that we could draw inspiration from is "Tabagotchi," a very similar chrome extension tool. This tool lowers the health of the tamagotchi every time a new tab is opened, and the pet will die when too many tabs are closed. We could draw inspiration for visual and UI elements from this reference. 

I also found an existing repo that displays just a simple tamagotchi in the browser, so we can draw inspiration from the basic setup of that project.

## Technical Details

### User Interface

The extension will display a small sidebar that displays the tamagotchi design, its health bar, and a "settings" button.

The "settings" button will take you to a website. This website will display the tamagotchi and its health bar, the list of off task and on task websites with options to add websites and delete websites, and the total nubmer of minutes spent on task and off task. 

### API, Libraries, and Frameworks

We plan to use the React framework to build our tool. 

### Data Storage

We need to store the current session's off task and on task time. We envision that we will store this data locally, so we do not need additional data storage. One of the TAs let us know that Chrome extensions have about 10mb of local storage, and part of their API (storage.local) that will help us manage that storage.

## Project Management

### Collaboration and Task Allocation

- **Leader:** Clara
- **Manager:** Laya
- **Remaining Team Members:** [John, Via]

  Clara: Help with the visual and UI design. 
  Laya: Delegate tasks and make sure things are completed. 
  John:  Help with overall project management and the software architecture. 
  Via: Help with the data storage component. 

We will use a shared GitHub respository, which we've already created, to share code.

### Risks and Mitigation

A potential risk is adding too many features and being unable to accomplish tasks becuase we are new to the project. One way to mitigate these risks is by ensuring that we get the basic functionality down before we move on to advanced features.

### Milestones and Timeline

- Week 1: draw up initial design, research & decide on stacks and frameworks, delegate tasks and start project
- Week 2: create framework for the project, build the UI components, get a functional tamagotchi display
- Week 3: add time storing functionality, add functionality to check which website user is on, create website to display all info
- Week 4: ensure that popup display works, ensure that website display works, integrate all components together

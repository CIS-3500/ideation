## Notes

A potential challenge is ensuring the AI understands the context and relevance of information accurately across different fields of study. Considering privacy concerns, it's important to clarify how data (highlights) is stored and managed.. Future iterations could include features like automatic citation generation and integration with academic databases for more comprehensive research support.

## Technical Details

### User Interface

Users will interact with the AI Research Assistant Chrome Extension primarily through a sidebar interface that appears in the Chrome browser. This sidebar will display summarized content from the current webpage or selected sections. Users can activate this sidebar by clicking on an extension icon in the Chrome toolbar or by selecting text and right-clicking to choose a "Summarize this section" option from the context menu. The interface will be designed for simplicity and ease of use, ensuring users of all technical levels can navigate and utilize the features effectively.

- **Sidebar Interface:** The sidebar will display the summarized content of the current webpage or selected passages.
- **Context Menu:** An option to summarize selected text on the webpage, enhancing flexibility and user control.
- **Browser Action:** The icon in the Chrome Toolbar for toggling the sidebar and accessing (potential) extension settings.

### API, Libraries, and Frameworks

- **OpenAI API:** Utilized to generate summaries of the page’s content through ChatGPT models, providing the user quick and accurate information.
  - [OpenAI API Documentation](https://platform.openai.com/docs/introduction)
  - [API Reference](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference)

- **Chrome Extensions API:** Used for integrating the sidebar, context menu, and browser action into the Chrome browser, facilitating user interaction with the extension.

### Risks and Mitigation

- **Risk #1:** Dependency on external APIs could lead to issues if the API becomes unavailable or changes.
  - **Risk Designation:** High
  - **Risk Severity:** Major
  - **Likelihood:** Moderate
  - **Mitigation Strategy:** Implement error handling and explore alternative APIs for backup. Keep the code modular to easily switch APIs if needed.

- **Risk #2:** Missed project milestone deadlines and deviation from the intended project schedule due to external commitments, miscalibrated expectations for the time required for project tasks, and general inefficiencies.
  - **Risk Designation:** Medium
  - **Severity:** Significant 
  - **Likelihood:** Moderate
  - **Mitigation Strategy:** Establish clear communication expectations from the beginning, set smaller, more frequent milestones, and factor in additional buffer time when creating project milestone deadlines to account for unexpected delays. Regular weekly (or more often, if needed) team meetings, clearly defined tasks, and team GCal with project planning deadlines.

- **Risk #3:** Inter-team conflicts and issues, including interpersonal conflicts that create a toxic work environment, team members not completing their designated tasks, and disagreements about the direction and implementation of the project.
  - **Risk Designation:** Medium
  - **Severity:** Significant
  - **Likelihood:** Unlikely
  - **Mitigation Strategy:** Clearly define the roles and expectations for each team member, foster a team culture of inclusivity and collaboration, and establish a process for regular check-ins and mediation of conflict.

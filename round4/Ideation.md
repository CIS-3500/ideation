Travelers, online shoppers, and professionals working across countries often face the challenge of dealing with multiple currencies. Calculating exchange rates can be tedious, error-prone, and time-consuming, especially when dealing with less familiar currencies. Our Chrome Extension simplifies this process by providing instant, accurate, and easy-to-access currency conversion directly in the browser. It eliminates the need to navigate away from the current webpage or use separate apps/tools, streamlining the user's workflow and enhancing their online experience.

## Target Audience
The target audience for our Chrome Extension includes frequent travelers, expatriates, international students, online shoppers buying from foreign websites, and professionals dealing with cross-border transactions. This audience primarily consists of individuals who regularly require quick and reliable currency conversion to budget, plan, and make informed decisions related to their international activities.

## Notes
A potential challenge might be ensuring that the currency conversion rates are updated in real-time, requiring a reliable and cost-effective API service. Additionally, we want to ensure that our extension does not significantly impact the browser's performance, especially when monitoring multiple currencies. User privacy is paramount, so we plan to design the extension to operate without collecting sensitive user data.

## References & Inspiration
Inspiration for our Chrome Extension came from existing currency conversion tools and financial apps, but we aim to integrate more seamlessly into the user's web browsing experience. We looked at popular currency conversion websites like XE.com and OANDA, as well as existing Chrome Extensions, to understand the features users value most and the gaps in current offerings.

## Problem Statement

By default, in order for users to change visual elements of webpages, they must manually inspect the underlying HTML/CSS, locate the desired elements, and change their states. This process is often time-consuming, if not difficult or even impossible for inexperienced or visually impaired users. We propose this extension as a way for users to customize these elements more easily.

## Target Audience

Targeted towards visually impaired individuals, specifically for colorblind and near-blind. Our extension will adjust the style of a website so that any text is larger. In addition, any coloring/style will be adjusted so that it's more clearly visible for individuals with color blindness.
Many individuals that are color blind or visually impaired struggle with viewing web pages that are not formatted well. They would significantly benefit from a tool that enlarges text and changes colors to be color-blind friendly. 
Additionally, the extension can also be used by other people who simply want an easy way to change such features for their own personal preferences.

## Description

This extension allows users to change visual features (e.g., text size, color) on websites to suit their preferences. Giving users a way to interact with these visual elements more directly and easily, the tool can be used for a variety of purposes, from accessibility to personalization.

## Selling Points

1. Enhanced accessibility for everyone.
2. Customizable styling. Users can change the size of fonts as well as the color/filters applied.
3. Convenience. Chrome extension will be applied automatically to every webpage.
4. Compatibility. Will be compatible with any type of website.
5. Personalization. Users can create and save certain themes/styles as favorites.

## User Stories

_[List user stories that describe the main features of your Chrome Extension. Use the following template: "As a [user role], I want to [goal] so that [benefit]." Fill in the brackets with the appropriate information. For Round 1, write 5 user stories; Round 2, write 10 user stories; Round 3, write 15 user stories.]_
1. As a colorblind user, I want to change the colors of various visual elements to colors that I can easily distinguish.
2. As a visually impaired user, I want to increase text size to make the text more readable.
3. As a user, I want to personalize webpages by changing colors, fonts, etc., to ones that I like.
4. As a user, I want to create certain styles that I like and save them as “favorites,” allowing me to easily apply them to other sites in the future.
5. As a user, I want to change background color to eliminate any distractions in the background.
6. As a user, I want to access some built-in themes, like dark mode and grayscale.

*Suggestion* color picker (like the eyedrop looking thing in paint softwares) that distinguishes very basic colors like red, yellow, blue and tells them to the user

## Notes

Color models in computer graphics
Consider using HSL or HSV to determine hue (red from yellow from blue, etc)
See basics of color section and “determine the value ranges [of the HSV or HSB model implementation used] before attempting to interpret a value.”
Rule of thumb: Start simple and reliable. Better to have a few features that always work instead many features that sometimes work.

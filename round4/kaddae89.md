## Authors

## Problem Statement

During the course selection period, students usually have to switch between tabs on path@penn and Penn Course Review to find courses that meet their difficulty and instructor quality requirements. This can be time consuming and tedious as students have to repeatedly switch tabs and search before deciding on which courses to add to their cart

## Target Audience

College (Penn) Students

## Description

## Selling Points

1. Provides course reviews while shopping
2. Removes the unnecessary tab switching during course selection
3. Speeds up the course selection process
4. Easy to use, intuitive interface
5. Potential to expand to other review based decision making processes
6. Allows user to filter for evaluations important to them

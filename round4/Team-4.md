## Problem Statement

It can be very easy to lose focus on work when using the internet through a web browser like Google Chrome. In today's digital age, the internet offers a vast array of content and websites, many of which can be engaging but ultimately detract from productivity and concentration. Oftentimes, wrestling with distracting content can detract from productivity and lead to information overload and procrastination.

## Target Audience

The Chome extension is usable by all Chrome users. However, the target audience is centered around people who utilize the Internet as a means to complete their work. This could be professionals, students, founders, hobbyists, and developers. Users should be looking for a simple way to manage their web usage in order to focus better, and may struggle with being distracted by websites like social media and gaming that would not be relevant to their goals at the moment.

## Description

LockIn Web Blocker offers features to help direct your attention to what matters most, reminding you to not visit websites that you deem as irrelevant to your current activity via content replacement.

## Notes

### Modes
1. **Ã€ La Carte**: Set and name a time period and a set of block lists to prevent access to these websites during this time.
2. **Scheduled**: Set and name a recurring time period and a set of block lists to prevent access during this time.
3. **Work**: Alternate between periods of named blocking (work) and unblocking (breaks) with times set dynamically and with a persistent but modifiable set of block lists.

### Block Lists
- Named block lists that ideally would all center around a specific group of websites
- Users can edit these block lists in the UI or dynamically add or modify websites as they are visited

### Analytics
- Visualization of block periods and task names
- Activity/Time on websites with block lists
- Use of various block lists
- Bypasses
- Total time with blocking active

### Bypassing
- Users should be allowed to bypass and remove blocking for websites with confirmation/passwords (which prevents impulse decisions)

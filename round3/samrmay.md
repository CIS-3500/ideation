## Problem Statement

Many individuals struggle with time management and productivity due to unintentional, excessive time spent on various websites. There is a need for an intuitive tool to help users analyze their browsing habits and increase the barrier to get distracted.

## Target Audience

- Students who need to manage their study time effectively.
- Professionals who want to minimize time-wasting websites during work hours.
- Anyone looking to improve their digital habits and productivity.


## Description

exTimesion is a Chrome extension that helps users track and analyze the time they spend on different websites. It provides detailed analytics on daily, weekly, and monthly browsing habits, identifying the most used websites, trends in usage, new and abandoned sites, and more. This information helps users understand their digital behavior and make informed decisions to improve their time management and productivity.

The extension also allows users to block websites that may be a detriment to browsing habits during work hours. Additionally, the user can maintain access to problematic websites but be shown unskippable ads to increase the "barrier to be distracted"

## Notes

 - Consider implementing a feature for shared devices where each user can have their own profile.
 - Explore the possibility of integrating with other productivity tools or platforms for a more holistic view of the user's time management.
 - Regular updates and improvements based on user feedback can help the extension stay relevant and useful.

 This strategy may be very easy to circumvent if the block-list is easily modifiable. There may need to be protections against editing which sites are blocked. Also probably not very effective for shopaholic

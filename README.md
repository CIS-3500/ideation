# CIS 3500-001 — Project Ideation — Spring 2024

This repository is for the ideation of the project. It is a place to share ideas and discuss them.

## In-Class Ideation (Rounds 1-3)

For this phase, use [`TEMPLATE-1.md`](TEMPLATE-1.md) to structure your ideas, replace the prompts in between brackets, and submit using a pull request in folders `round1`, `round2`, and `round3`.

### At Each Round

- [Create a fork](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/fork-a-repo)
- Write a new file in the `roundX` directory with your PennKey and the `.md` extension (i.e., I would write a file called `lumbroso.md`) according to `TEMPLATE.md` (see also `SAMPLE-1.md` and `SAMPLE-2.md` for examples).
- [Create a pull request from the fork](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork)

### Rounds

Here are how the rounds are structured:

- **Round 1 (15-20 mins):** Think on your own about a single story that you will submit in `round1` directory.
- **Round 2 (15-20 mins):**
  - Pair up with someone else,
  - Each present each other's idea (5 mins)
  - Determine which idea is the one you most would like to work on (2 min)
  - Expand the idea with 5 more user stories (8 mins)
  - Submit the expanded idea in `round2` directory under the name of the person who's idea it originally was.
- **Round 3 (15-20 mins):**
  - Pair up with another pair (4 people in total, 2 ideas)
  - Each present each other's idea (5 mins)
  - Determine which idea is the one you most would like to work on (2 min)
  - Expand the idea with 5 more user stories (8 mins)
  - Submit the expanded idea in `round2` directory under the name of the person who's idea it originally was.

## Final Project Ideation (Round 4)

For this phase, use [`TEMPLATE-2.md`](TEMPLATE-2.md) to structure your ideas (it is the same as `TEMPLATE-1.md`, but with additional section after "_References & Inspiration_"), replace the prompts in between brackets, and submit using a pull request in the `round4` directory.

Name this file as `team-XX.md` where `XX` is your team number (`team-01.md`, `team-19.md`, etc.).

**You must complete the proposal in two steps:**
- **By Monday Apr 1 at 11:59 PM ET:** Complete everything up until the "_References & Inspiration_" section, **but NOT the "Technical Details" section and below**.
  - ⚠️ Don't forget to also submit the [TA Bidding Form](https://forms.gle/oFzxsmSvSsKJSwLE6) by the same time.
- **By Wednesday Apr 3 at 11:59 PM ET:** Complete the entire proposal.

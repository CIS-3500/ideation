# Project: Anti-Copycat Fashion Extension

## Problem Statement

Fast fashion has led to the rise of many copycat and scam websites. A lot of small businesses and designers have had their designs ripped off by sites that mass-produce clothing, making it hard for them to stay afloat and reducing their revenue. Most consumers would rather purchase clothing from the original designer to support them, as they can get scammed by these sites, and the clothing could be of better quality.

## Target Audience

This project is targeted towards small business owners and designers, as well as consumers who are interested in fashion. More broadly, it is for consumers who like to shop online and wish to make more ethical and informed purchases.

## Description

The core idea of this extension is to introduce a popup feature that activates when a consumer discovers an article of clothing they like online. This feature would compare the images and descriptions of the piece, helping the customer determine if they are buying a copycat or the original item. If the item is not original, the extension can direct them to the website of the original designer.

## Selling Points

- **Supports Small Businesses:** By directing consumers to the original products, small businesses can reclaim sales lost to copycats.

- **Better Quality:** Original products often have better quality than their knockoffs.
- **Industry Awareness:** Raises awareness about the corruption and unethical practices in the fast fashion industry.

## Authors

Jason Figueroa 

## Problem Statement

People may want to get access to a site, article, free trial, etc. 
Many of these sites require signing up with an email. However, many 
times you donâ€™t want to sign up with your main email to avoid spam.

## Target Audience

Target Audience Includes:
- Users who want to read sign up block articles 
- Users who want to sign up to a free trial to a sit


## Description

Whenever there is a site that requires email sign up, 
simply click on the extension and that will autofill 
with a newly created email and password. 

## Selling Points

1. Repeated Free trials for sites
2. Quick access to sites (no need to manually create email)
3. Avoid spam emails/unwanted email lists
4. News articles without having to sign up
5. Academic tool to help access study sites behind email sign in 

## User Stories

As a user interested in accessing multiple free trials without using my primary email, 
I want to generate and use a unique temporary email for each trial, so that I can enjoy 
the benefits without the risk of spam or compromising my personal information.

As a student who needs access to premium study materials blocked behind email signups, 
I want to use temporary emails to register on educational websites, so that I can obtain 
the resources without cluttering my school email with marketing messages.

As a privacy-conscious individual wary of sharing personal details online, 
I want to use temporary emails when signing up for newsletters or accounts, 
so that I can protect my identity and keep my primary email address private.

As a professional researching competitive products and services, 
I want to sign up for competitor newsletters and access gated content without 
revealing my work email, so that I can gather information discreetly using temporary emails.

As an enthusiast who loves entering online contests and giveaways, 
I want to increase my chances of winning by signing up multiple times with 
different emails, so that I can do so without receiving a barrage of promotional
emails in my main inbox.

## Notes

Potential challenges: 
- Dealing with the clean up of many random generated emails (when to delete, etc.)
- Legality of multiple free trials


## References & Inspiration

I used to want to look at different quizlets for studying but always have a new email for the free trial of quizlet plus. 
The site below would help me circumvent that, but I believe it would be easier in a chrome extension
